# Crate Digger Documentation

The main resource here is the [Export Structure Analysis
site](https://djl-analysis.deepsymmetry.org/rekordbox-export-analysis/exports.html).
It is built from the [Antora component](antora.yml) by a [playbook in
the dysentery
project](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery/blob/master/doc/github-actions.yml)
by a [GitHub
Action](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery/blob/master/.github/workflows/analysis.yml)
in that repository.

Of historical interest only is the older [LaTeX version](Analysis.tex)
of the document.
